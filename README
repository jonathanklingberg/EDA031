1. 'make' in the parent folder makes the library libclientserver.a.

2. 'make' inside the subdirectory ’test’ makes the executables myclient, inmemoryserver and ondiskserver but don’t forget to make the library in the parent folder first.

3. The subdirectory 'test' now contains the test programs myclient, inmemoryserver and ondiskserver.

4. Start the in memory version of the server by entering the test folder from a terminal and then enter: ’./inmemoryserver 1337’.

5. Run the java-tester from another terminal window: ’java -jar BetterTestServer2.jar localhost 1337’

6. Hit the ’run all tests’-button, look at the result and exit the testprogram.

7. Open a terminal, enter the test-folder and now run the CLI-client: ’./myclient localhost 1337’

8. Hit ’-h’ to list all available commands and follow the instructions from there.

9. Exit the CLI and terminate the in memory server and repeat everything from step 4 but now run the on disk version of the server by replacing the command in step 4 with the following: ’./ondiskmemory 1337’.
