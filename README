1. 'make' in the parent folder makes the library libclientserver.a along with the executables myclient, inmemoryserver and ondiskserver inside the parent folder ./test.

2. The subdirectory 'test' now contains the test programs myclient, inmemoryserver and ondiskserver.

3. Start the in memory version of the server by entering the test folder from a terminal and then enter: ’./inmemoryserver 13666’. If you get ”Server initialization error” try another port number. 

4. Run the java-tester from another terminal window: ’java -jar BetterTestServer2.jar localhost 13666’

5. Hit the ’run all tests’-button, look at the result and exit the testprogram.

6. Open a terminal, enter the test-folder and now run the CLI-client: ’./myclient localhost 13666’

7. Hit ’-h’ to list all available commands and follow the instructions from there.

8. Exit the CLI and terminate the in memory server and repeat everything from step 4 but now run the on disk version of the server by replacing the command in step 4 with the following: ’./ondiskmemory 13666’.
